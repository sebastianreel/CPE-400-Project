# CPE 400: Final Project
## Implement a File Transfer Application

**Authors: _Sebastian Reel, Keegan Graf, Kim Meza Martinez_**

Parameters for assignment:
> Write a simple client-server socket programming. This program will be used to transfer files from 
> client to server. The server will be listening on a port (say port# 5050) and the Client will connect to 
> Server and transfer files to Server. Here are the details:

  > 1. Client will take the source folder path (i.e., folder that contains files) and the number of concurrent 
  > file transfers as command-line arguments. For example, "java Client folder 5" will transfer files in 
  > “myFolder” folder to destination five at a time. In other words, concurrent file transfer means 
  > transferring multiple files over separate connections to increase overall throughput. If the concurrency 
  > number is not entered, it should transfer one file at a time (aka concurrency=1), by default.
  
  > 2. The application should support integrity verification. That is, your client and server will calculate 
  > the checksum of each file after it is transferred and compare them to make sure data is transferred 
  > without any error in the network.
